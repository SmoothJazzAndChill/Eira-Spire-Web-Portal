		<h3>Welcome to the Eira Spire web portal!</h3>
		<p>Here you can add and alter Characters, Pages and other aspects of the Eira Spire App.</p>
		<h4>What's this for?</h4>
		<p>As part of my new job I've been building Mobile Apps, and I had the idea that it would be cool for Eira Spire
			to have an app that acts as an offical repository of information that newcomers to the Hall could download
			and look at without having to give strangers the link to the OneNote.</p>
		<p>After building the App I decided that it would be better for the content to be dynamic rather than hard coded
			so I setup a database for it to pull the data from. This had the problem of being a pain to edit and wasn't
			accessible to others, so I built this Portal to act as a backend for the mobile App that can be accessed by
			anyone.</p>
		<p>This site is best viewed on Desktop. You can use a mobile web browser, but the interface is not designed with
			that in mind.</p>
		<p>If you encounter any issues or have any questions, contact Simon. Don't hesitate to offer suggestions for improvement</p>
